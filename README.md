# Design Patterns in C#

This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns using C# and .NET 6. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design, making code more maintainable, flexible, and easier to understand.

## Implemented Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.
- **Builder Pattern** - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Facade Pattern** - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Factory Pattern** - Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
- **Singleton Pattern** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Project Structure
